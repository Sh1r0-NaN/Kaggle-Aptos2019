# Kaggle-Aptos2019

My solution ranked 22th out of 2,943 on the [aptos2019-blindness-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection). 

1. **Preprocessing**

    I tried circle crop and Ben's Preprocessing. 
    But it didn't work.
    So finally the preprocessing did nothing.

2. **Models and Input sizes**

    My final submission was a simple average of the three EfficientNetB5 models with different input sizes.
    I wanted to try other models such as ResNets, 
    but I gave up because I only had kaggle's kernel as a computational resource.


3. **Augmentations**

4. **Training**
